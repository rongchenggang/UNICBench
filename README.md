## 🔍 Abstract

Counting is a core capability for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), yet there is no unified counting dataset to rigorously evaluate this ability across image, text, and audio. We present UNICBench, a unified multimodal, multi level counting benchmark and evaluation toolkit with accurate ground truth, deterministic numeric parsing, and stratified reporting. The corpus comprises 5,300 images (5,508 QA), 872 documents (5,888 QA), and 2,069 audio clips (2,905 QA), annotated with a three level capability taxonomy and difficulty tags. Under a standardized protocol with fixed splits/prompts/seeds and modality specific matching rules, we evaluate 45 state-of-the-art MLLMs across modalities. Results show strong performance on some basic counting tasks but significant gaps on reasoning and the hardest partitions, highlighting long-tail errors and substantial headroom for improving general counting. UNICBench offers a rigorous and comparable basis for measurement and a public toolkit to accelerate progress.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rongchenggang/UNICBench.git
cd UNICBench
```

### 2. Download Dataset

Download the dataset from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/rongchenggang/UNICBench) and place it in `UNICBench-Evaluation/UNICBench/`:

```bash
# The dataset should be organized as:
UNICBench-Evaluation/
└── UNICBench/
    ├── image/          # Image counting data (49 categories)
    ├── text/           # Text counting data (12 categories)  
    └── audio/          # Audio counting data (2 categories)
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd UNICBench-Evaluation
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Or use conda
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate unicbench
```

### 4. Configure Your Model

Edit `evaluation/models/models_config.py` to add your API credentials:

```python
AVAILABLE_MODELS = {
    "your-model": [
        {
            "type": "OPENAI",
            "base": "https://api.openai.com/v1", 
            "key": "sk-your-api-key-here",
            "engine": "gpt-4o",
            "max_tokens": 4096,
            "temperature": 0.0
        }
    ]
}
```

### 5. Run Evaluation

```bash
# Image counting
python evaluation/run_image_counting.py

# Text counting  
python evaluation/run_text_counting.py

# Audio counting
python evaluation/run_audio_counting.py
```

The scripts will interactively guide you through model selection, category selection, and task configuration.
